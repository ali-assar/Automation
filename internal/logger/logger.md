## `logger` Package - Centralized Logging Setup

### Overview

The `logger` package provides a unified logging interface for the application, built on top of the [`logrus`](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) logging library. It allows consistent logging formats and levels across all components, with minimal setup.

---

### Initialization

#### `Init(logLevel, logFormat string)`

Initializes the logger with the specified log level and format. This should be called early in the application's startup (typically in `main.go`) using values from environment variables.

* **`logLevel`**: One of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`
* **`logFormat`**:

  * `"json"` for machine-readable structured logs
  * any other value defaults to plain text with full timestamps

**Example:**

```go
logger.Init("debug", "json")
```

---

### Logging Functions

Shorthand helpers for common logging levels:

```go
logger.Info("App started on port 8080")
logger.Warn("Disk space is low")
logger.Error("Unable to connect to DB")
logger.Debug("Request headers:", headers)
```

---

### Structured Logging

Use `WithField` or `WithFields` to attach contextual data to logs:

```go
logger.WithField("user_id", 42).Info("User logged in")

logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
    "order_id": 123,
    "amount":   99.95,
}).Warn("Order processing delayed")
```

---

### Default Behavior

* If an invalid log level is provided, it defaults to `info`.
* If format is anything other than `"json"`, the logger uses human-readable text output with full timestamps.
* All logs are output to `stdout`.

---

### Best Practices

* Initialize the logger **before** other packages (e.g., config) to catch early errors.
* Use structured logging (`WithField` / `WithFields`) in middleware, services, and error cases for better traceability.

---

### Suggested Next Package to Document

Now that `config` and `logger` are covered, the next most logical part is likely:

### ðŸ”œ `backend/internal/server` or `main.go`

This part typically:

* Initializes `config` and `logger`
* Sets up HTTP routers, middleware, and services
* Starts the application server
